# Berlin Anmeldung Scrapper

You're in berlin and you want to
[register as a citzen (anmeldung)?](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/)

Instead of going through the calendar and finding out that all the appointments
are damn far away, with this CLI you can easily find where and when to go.

![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3609616/26153367/48e93028-3b0b-11e7-92d9-650114ccd1a9.gif)

Isn't this overkill? I wanted to try `tty` gem and...well `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
